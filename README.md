# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

This project focuses on segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis. It was built using **Python** and executed in **Google Colab**.

## 📌 Objective

To identify distinct groups of customers based on how recently and frequently they purchase, and how much they spend — helping businesses make data-driven marketing and customer retention decisions.

---

## 📊 RFM Explained

- **Recency (R)** – Days since last purchase  
- **Frequency (F)** – Number of transactions  
- **Monetary (M)** – Total spending by the customer  

These metrics are scored and grouped to classify customers such as:
- 🛍️ **Loyal Customers**
- ❄️ **At-Risk Customers**
- 🆕 **New Customers**
- 💸 **Big Spenders**
- 🚫 **Churned Customers**

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Scikit-learn (for clustering)
- datetime
